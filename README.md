I am a third-year Computer Engineering student with a disciplined and goal-oriented approach to learning and self-improvement. I focus not only on achieving results but also on understanding the underlying structure and logic of problems. I value responsibility, systematic progress, and combining technical knowledge with effective teamwork.

In the long term, I aim to develop my technical skills through real-world engineering challenges and contribute meaningful value within a high-standard, engineering-driven organization.
